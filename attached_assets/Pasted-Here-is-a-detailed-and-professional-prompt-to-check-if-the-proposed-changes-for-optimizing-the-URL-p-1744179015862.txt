**Prompt: Check for Implementation of URL Path Optimization Changes and Generate a Report**

**Objective**: Ensure that all proposed optimizations for the URL paths (both front-end and back-end) have been implemented. Once verified, generate a detailed report on the status of the implementation.

**Details**:

1. **Check if All URL Paths Are Grouped Logically**:
   - Verify if the front-end routes are structured logically, grouping similar content types (e.g., movies, series, actors, genres) under clear and meaningful paths like `/movies`, `/series`, `/genres`, etc.
   - Ensure that backend API endpoints are also grouped by content type and functionality (e.g., `/api/content`, `/api/users`, `/api/tmdb`).

2. **Ensure Consistency in URL Naming and Parameters**:
   - Check if all URL paths follow a consistent naming convention, such as using slugs instead of IDs (e.g., `/movies/the-matrix` instead of `/movies/12345`).
   - Ensure that parameters are standardized across both front-end and back-end (e.g., using `:slug` for identifiers, `:genre-slug` for genres).

3. **Verify Logical Hierarchy in URL Paths**:
   - Ensure that hierarchical structures are followed for related content, such as `/series/:series-slug/season/:season-number` for specific seasons or episodes.
   - Check if all related endpoints are logically nested under the correct parent path, like `/api/tmdb/movies/popular` for popular movies.

4. **Ensure Readability and SEO Optimization**:
   - Verify that URLs use hyphens (`-`) to separate words, ensuring readability and SEO optimization (e.g., `/movies/popular` instead of `/movies/popular_movies`).
   - Ensure that URL paths are meaningful and SEO-friendly, using keywords like "popular," "latest," "top-rated," and "search."

5. **Confirm the Use of Higher-Level Categories**:
   - Ensure that higher-level categories (e.g., `/support`, `/legal`, `/admin`) are used to group related pages, keeping the structure clean and easy to navigate.

6. **Check for API Integration and Cleanliness**:
   - Verify that API endpoints for interacting with content, user profiles, and TMDB data are consistent and correctly follow RESTful principles (e.g., `/api/content/:id/similar` for similar content).
   - Ensure that unnecessary or redundant endpoints have been merged or removed (e.g., consolidating `/api/content/search` and `/api/tmdb/search/unified`).

7. **Generate a Comprehensive Report**:
   - After reviewing all paths and implementations, provide a status report that includes the following:
     - A summary of changes made to the URL structure.
     - Confirmation of whether all proposed URL optimizations (e.g., hierarchy, consistency, readability, SEO) have been implemented.
     - Any discrepancies or areas that still require attention or modification.

**Request**:
Please verify if the changes mentioned in the proposed URL structure optimization have been fully implemented. Once verified, kindly generate and provide a detailed report on the following aspects:

- Logical grouping of front-end and back-end URL paths.
- Consistency in naming conventions and use of slugs.
- Hierarchical organization of paths.
- Use of hyphens for SEO and readability.
- Proper use of higher-level categories and structure.
- Integration and cleanliness of API endpoints.
  
If everything is in place, provide the confirmation. If any discrepancies exist, please highlight those and suggest next steps for rectification.
