Sure! Here’s a detailed and technical prompt that you can use to guide the AI to review the file structure and routing for the website, and fix any issues related to page loading, empty pages, and missing content. The goal is to ensure that all routes and paths are correctly mapped and that each section (e.g., login, registration) displays the appropriate content as it did previously.

### **Prompt: Fix Routing and Content Display Issues in the Website**

**Objective:**
Fix the routing and content display issues on the website where certain pages (like login/registration) and sections (like content pages) are returning empty or broken pages. Ensure the routing system is working as expected, with all pages rendering their intended content and applying the appropriate styles and templates.

---

### **Key Issues to Address:**
1. **Broken Pages and Empty Content:**
   - Certain sections (like login/registration) are now rendering empty pages or blank screens.
   - Previously, these pages were correctly displaying content and styled elements.
   - The issue is likely due to incorrect routing or path configurations, and some components/pages might not be properly mapped.

2. **Missing Content in Sections (e.g., Footer, Login, Registration):**
   - When clicking on certain navigation links (like "Login" or "Sign Up"), the page appears empty or does not load content as it should.
   - Previously, these pages contained pre-defined content, layouts, and styles.
   - The issue may have been caused by routing misconfigurations or missing imports for components.

3. **Content and Styling Issues:**
   - Content is missing from certain routes, and previously styled elements (like forms, buttons, etc.) are no longer rendering properly.
   - Ensure that styles and components are being correctly loaded for each route, and that the page structure is correctly rendered.

### **Step-by-Step Actions for Fixing the Issues:**

1. **Check Route Configuration and Paths:**
   - Go through the **router** configuration (likely in `App.js` or `App.tsx` if using React Router or any equivalent routing setup).
   - Ensure that all pages and components are correctly mapped to their respective routes. For example:
     - `/login` should load the login component.
     - `/signup` should load the sign-up component.
     - `/profile` should load the user profile page.
   - Verify that each path has a corresponding component and that the paths are correctly defined in the router.

     **Example:**
     ```js
     <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
     <Route path="/signup" element={<SignUp />} />
     <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
     ```

   - **Note:** Make sure the paths in the `Link` components (or navigation buttons) match the route paths exactly.

2. **Check Import Statements for Missing Components:**
   - In the relevant route files (e.g., `Login.js`, `SignUp.js`, `Profile.js`), ensure that the components are being properly imported.
   - If you notice any component missing or imported incorrectly, fix the imports to ensure the correct content is rendered.
   
   **Example:**
   ```js
   import Login from './components/Login';
   import SignUp from './components/SignUp';
   ```

3. **Ensure Correct Layout and Component Nesting:**
   - Review how each component is rendered and check for proper nesting of elements.
   - Ensure that content components are wrapped in a layout component if needed. For instance, login and signup forms might require a layout wrapper, but other content pages might require something different.

   **Example Layout:**
   ```js
   const MainLayout = ({ children }) => (
     <div className="main-layout">
       <Header />
       <div className="content">{children}</div>
       <Footer />
     </div>
   );
   ```

   **Usage in Routing:**
   ```js
   <Route path="/login" element={<MainLayout><Login /></MainLayout>} />
   <Route path="/signup" element={<MainLayout><SignUp /></MainLayout>} />
   ```

4. **Verify Data Fetching and State Management:**
   - Some sections might require data to be fetched before rendering (e.g., the user profile might need user data from an API).
   - Verify if any `useEffect` or `useQuery` hooks are failing or if there are errors in the API calls.
   - Check the console for any errors related to missing data or failed API calls.
   - If data fetching is required, ensure that the data is being fetched asynchronously and properly passed to the components.

5. **Check for Conditional Rendering Logic:**
   - Ensure that the logic for rendering different sections (e.g., login vs. dashboard vs. profile) is correct.
   - If there are conditionals like `if (userLoggedIn)` or `if (!userLoggedIn)`, ensure they are working as expected and not causing components to render incorrectly or not at all.

   **Example:**
   ```js
   if (!isUserLoggedIn) {
     return <Redirect to="/login" />;
   }
   ```

6. **Ensure Correct Routing in Nested Pages:**
   - If there are nested routes (e.g., `/profile/settings` or `/movie/:id`), ensure they are correctly configured.
   - **Nested routes** should render their child components within the parent component. For example, the `Profile` component should render the profile settings if the user navigates to `/profile/settings`.

   **Example:**
   ```js
   <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />}>
     <Route path="settings" element={<ProfileSettings />} />
   </Route>
   ```

7. **Check and Fix CSS/Styling:**
   - Ensure that CSS or styling files are properly linked or imported in the pages that are displaying empty content.
   - If some elements are not styled correctly or missing, make sure the right CSS/SCSS files are being imported in the relevant components.

   **Example Import:**
   ```js
   import './Login.css';
   ```

   - **Check Global Styles:** Verify that global styles (like `body`, `html`, or `App.css`) are not overriding important styles in specific components.

8. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test each page route by manually navigating to the paths in your browser (e.g., `/login`, `/signup`, `/profile`).
   - Use the **React Developer Tools** to inspect the component tree and ensure all components are properly rendered.
   - Test each feature to ensure that forms and interactions are functional (e.g., login form submits, registration form saves data).

9. **Document Route and Path Structure:**
   - Create a document or a roadmap that outlines the entire route structure of your app. This will help avoid confusion and help identify missing or misconfigured routes.

   **Example Route Structure:**
   - `/login` → LoginComponent
   - `/signup` → SignUpComponent
   - `/profile` → ProfileComponent
     - `/profile/settings` → ProfileSettingsComponent

### **Important Notes:**

- **Avoid Breaking Existing Components:** While fixing routes and paths, be cautious not to modify any existing functionality unless necessary. Ensure that you do not disrupt previously working features.
- **Consistency Across Routes:** Ensure that all routes follow a consistent naming convention and path structure to avoid confusion in the long term.
- **Error Boundaries:** Add proper error boundaries around critical components (e.g., login, registration, user profile) to catch any rendering or data-fetching errors.
