پرامپت برای طراحی صفحه دسته‌بندی‌های فیلم با استایل گلاسمورفیسم
I need to redesign the page that opens when a user clicks on the categories in the footer of the site (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Horror). The new design should follow a modern Glassmorphism aesthetic, consistent with the rest of the website. The design should be clean, smooth, and responsive, with seamless integration of glass-like effects. Follow the specific details below:

1. Overall Layout & Structure:
Create a full-width page layout with a fixed header and footer consistent with the rest of the site.

Glassmorphism Effect: The background of the page should have a frosted-glass effect (using backdrop-filter: blur()), with a slight blur to the background while maintaining clarity of the content. The cards containing each movie category should have a subtle glass-like effect.

Example CSS:

css
Copy
Edit
.glass-background {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
}
2. Category Cards Design (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Horror):
For each category (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Horror), create visually appealing cards that display the name of the category and a thumbnail or icon representing the genre.

The cards should be responsive and scale well on different screen sizes.

Each card should have the Glassmorphism effect applied, with subtle animations on hover (e.g., card expansion or a slight blur effect to add interactivity).

The categories should appear in a grid layout, with spacing between the cards, and the grid should adjust automatically for mobile screens.

Example CSS for cards:

css
Copy
Edit
.category-card {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 20px;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}
.category-card:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
3. Navigation and Transitions:
Implement smooth page transitions when switching between categories. Use fade-in/fade-out animations to enhance the user experience.

For each category click (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.), load the relevant movies or shows dynamically without refreshing the page, maintaining a fluid user experience.

Use JavaScript or React for dynamic loading, ensuring that users don’t experience page reloads. Consider implementing lazy loading for images.

4. Category Filters and Sorting Options:
Provide filter options (e.g., by rating, release year, etc.) on the left or top of the page, and these should appear as glass-like dropdown menus that fit the Glassmorphism style.

Ensure that these filter options are close to the categories for better usability.

Example CSS for filter dropdowns:

css
Copy
Edit
.filter-dropdown {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 10px;
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}
5. Typography and Color Scheme:
Use elegant, clean typography that complements the Glassmorphism design. Use fonts like Roboto, Open Sans, or Montserrat for headings and body text.

The text color should be in contrast with the background to ensure readability, with shades of light gray or white for titles and content text.

Ensure that the primary brand colors are incorporated subtly in the design, e.g., for buttons, hover states, or section highlights.

6. Interactive Elements (Buttons, Hover Effects):
The page should feature interactive buttons (e.g., "See More" or "View Movies") that align with the Glassmorphism style, incorporating frosted-glass effects, subtle hover animations, and smooth transitions.

Buttons should expand slightly on hover and change background color to a light shade, indicating interactivity.

Example CSS for buttons:

css
Copy
Edit
.btn {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 12px 20px;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease;
}
.btn:hover {
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
    transform: scale(1.05);
}
7. Footer Design:
The footer should maintain the same glass-like appearance as the rest of the site but should be more minimalistic to avoid visual clutter. Include social media links, and other relevant footer content (e.g., copyright, contact info).

The footer can also have a blurred background with simple text or icons, providing a clean and modern look.

8. Performance Optimization:
Use lazy loading for images and sections, especially for the category thumbnails and posters, to ensure the page loads efficiently without slowing down.

Use SVG icons for genres or other graphical elements to reduce load times and keep the design sharp on all screen sizes.

Summary:
Glassmorphism effects should be applied consistently throughout the design.

The categories (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Horror) should be displayed in sleek, responsive cards with hover animations.

Navigation should be intuitive, with filters and sorting options close to the categories, using glass-like dropdown menus.

The design should be fluid and modern, with smooth animations and transitions that make the user experience seamless.
